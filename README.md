# Automated Chatbot with Twilio and GCP

This project implements an automated chatbot that can receive and respond to messages using Twilio, distinguish whether the message is from a client or staff, and take appropriate action. The chatbot server runs on a local machine (physical server) using tools like **Twilio**, **ngrok**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and **Cloud Gemini**.

## üöÄ Features
- Automatically receive and respond to messages using Twilio.
- Distinguish between messages from clients and staff.
- Utilize artificial intelligence for interpreting and responding to messages.
- Securely configure on a local server exposed to the internet via ngrok.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

### 1. **Python**
The main programming language used to develop the chatbot server and process messages.

### 2. **Twilio**
A platform for managing communication via SMS and other channels. Provides APIs for receiving and sending messages.

### 3. **ngrok**
A tool to securely expose your local server to the internet, allowing external platforms like Twilio to communicate with it.

### 4. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
Used to integrate additional services like databases, storage, or AI APIs to enhance chatbot functionality.

### 5. **Cloud Gemini**
An AI platform for advanced natural language processing, enabling the chatbot to tailor its responses based on message content.

### Installing Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install twilio flask google-cloud-dialogflow

üåê Main Python Code
Below is the main Python code for configuring your server:

python
from flask import Flask, request
from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/sms", methods=["POST"])
def sms_reply():
    # Extract the incoming message
    incoming_msg = request.form.get("Body")
    sender = request.form.get("From")
    
    # Create a response
    response = MessagingResponse()
    
    # Logic to differentiate client and staff messages
    if "client" in incoming_msg.lower():
        response.message("Hello client! How can I assist you?")
    elif "staff" in incoming_msg.lower():
        response.message("Hi team, processing your request.")
    else:
        response.message("Hi, thank you for reaching out. I'm here to help!")

    return str(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
Configuring ngrok
Open a terminal and run:

bash
ngrok http 5000
Copy the public URL generated by ngrok (e.g., https://xyz.ngrok.io) and configure it as a Webhook in the Twilio dashboard.
